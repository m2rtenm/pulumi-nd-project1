# Infrastructure as a Code with Pulumi in Azure and AWS

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate examples how to deploy infrastructure with Pulumi to Azure and AWS. The inspiration was taken from the Cloud DevOps nanodegree by Udacity. During the nanodegree, I completed the first IaaC project using Terraform to deploy infrastructure in Azure. I adapted the setup and made a similar approach in AWS. This repo helps to present the way how the deployment can be done using Pulumi.
